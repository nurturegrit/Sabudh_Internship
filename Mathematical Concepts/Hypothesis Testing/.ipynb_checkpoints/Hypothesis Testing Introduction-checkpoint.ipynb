    "\n",
    "### Significance Level (α)\n",
    "- **Definition:** The threshold used to decide whether the p-value is low enough to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Common Value:** Typically set at 0.05, meaning there’s a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n",
    "- **Definition in Example:** The threshold you choose to determine if the evidence from your sample is strong enough to reject the company's claim. In this example, a common significance level is 0.05, meaning you are willing to accept a 5% chance of concluding that the average weight of the candies is different from 10 grams when it actually is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type I Error (False Positive)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Occurs when you reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Concluding there is an effect or difference when there isn't one.\n",
    "- **Definition in Example:** Occurs when you conclude that the average weight of the candies is different from 10 grams (rejecting the company's claim) when, in reality, the average weight is indeed 10 grams. This means you incorrectly detect a difference that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type II Error (False Negative)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Occurs when you fail to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- **Implication:** Failing to detect an effect or difference when there is one.\n",
    "- **Definition in Example:** Occurs when you fail to reject the company's claim (concluding the average weight is 10 grams) when, in reality, the average weight is different from 10 grams. This means you miss detecting a difference that actually exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power of the Test\n",
    "- **Definition:** The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n",
    "- **Factors Influencing Power:** Sample size, effect size, and significance level.\n",
    "- **Definition in Example:** The probability of correctly detecting a significant difference from the claimed average weight of 10 grams when there actually is a difference. Higher power means a greater chance of detecting this difference if it exists. Factors that influence power include the sample size (larger samples increase power), the true effect size (larger differences are easier to detect), and the significance level (a higher α increases power).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Intervals\n",
    "- **Definition:** A range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Provides additional context and insight into the precision of the sample estimate.\n",
    "- **Definition in Example:** After conducting your test, you might also calculate a confidence interval for the average weight of the candies. For example, a 95% confidence interval might give a range of values within which you are 95% confident the true average weight lies. This helps you understand the range of possible average weights based on your sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect Size\n",
    "- **Definition:** Measures the magnitude of the difference or effect observed in the study.\n",
    "- **Importance:** Helps in understanding the practical significance of the findings, beyond just statistical significance.\n",
    "- **Definition in Example:** Measures how substantial the difference is between the sample mean and the claimed mean of 10 grams. For instance, if the sample mean is 9.99 grams, the effect size tells you how significant this difference is in practical terms, not just statistically. A small effect size means the difference is minor, while a large effect size indicates a more substantial difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "- **Significance Level (α):** Set at 0.05, you use this to determine whether the p-value from your test is low enough to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Type I Error (False Positive):** Incorrectly concluding that the average weight is not 10 grams when it actually is.\n",
    "- **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to detect a difference when the average weight is actually different from 10 grams.\n",
    "- **Power of the Test:** The likelihood of detecting a significant difference if the true average weight is different from 10 grams.\n",
    "- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide a range where the true average weight of the candies is likely to be, given your sample data.\n",
    "- **Effect Size:** Indicates the magnitude of the difference between the sample mean and the claimed mean of 10 grams."
